# GetGround BI Task

Welcome to GetGround's BI Task! We hope you find it fun.

We've included some data from SQL tables in CSV format. The goal will be to insert this data into a SQL database on your local machine; run some SQL queries and analysis; document, explain and visualize your response to the questions asked.

## The Data

GetGround currently has end-customers referred to us by partners, such as lettings agents and mortgage brokers. The customer then signs up for our service, and we pay the partner a small commission per referrals. Referrals are on a company level: a customer who signs up for five companies counts as five referrals. Five customers in one company count as one referral.

Partners each have consultants, such as Joe Smith working at Lettings Agent A. The referrals are attributed to the specific consultant at a partner.

The data tables provided are as follows:

```
partners
	id
	created_at
	updated_at
	partner_type
  lead_sales_contact
```

```
sales people
  name
  country
```

```
referrals
	id
	created_at
	updated_at
  company_id
	partner_id
	consultant_id
	status
	is_outbound
```


For referrals, the `updated_at` field essentially says when the status went from `pending` to either `disinterested` or `successful`. Timestamps are in Unix Nano format.

`is_outbound` is `true` when we refer a customer to a partner, i.e. "upsell". In this case we send them the customer, and they pay _us_ a commission. We haven't done this very thoroughly yet, so most referrals are inbound.

Our sales people work in a "key account" model. Referrals come from partners, and a sales person typically manages partner accounts.

We currently have sales people in the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong.

## Questions and Exercises

1. Please insert the data provided as CSV into SQL tables on your computer or a tool of your choice. Please include SQL queries used throughout the assignment.

2. Analyse the data. What insights can you find? Be sure to include your investigative thought process, findings, limitations, and assumptions.

3. Use visualisations wherever helpful.

4. Propose any conclusions from the data. Propose any future work.
